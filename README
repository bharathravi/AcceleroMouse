WARNING: Hacky code.
If you still want to risk it:
1. Start "server/mouse.py" with the following options, on a linux machine:
    ./server/mouse.py --ip=<ipaddress> --port=<port>
2. Install AcceleroMouse.apk on your phone.
3. Run it.
4. Enter the IP address and port of the server on the app.
5. Hopefully, have fun.

Moving the mouse:
The mouse moves by rotation of the phone, and not by displacing the phone.
Basically imagine you're playin a pinball game with the mouse, using your phone.

Y-axis: tilt phone up/down.
X-axis: rotate the phone to the left and right, like locking/unlocking with a key.

Click: tap touch screen.
Double-click: double tap touch screen.
